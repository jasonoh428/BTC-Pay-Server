* Do not want to give custody or control of your funds to a third party
* Have been rejected by BitPay for KYC/AML reasons after developing your solution
* Are a service provider who wants to offer Bitcoin payments to your customer with a different pricing model than BitPay
* Want to propose services similar to BitPay for an alt-currency.
