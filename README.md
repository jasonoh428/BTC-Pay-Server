# BTCPay Server

## Introduction 

BTCPay Server is an Open Source payment processor, written in C#, that conforms to the invoice API of [Bitpay](https://bitpay.com/).
This allows easy migration of your code base to your own, self-hosted payment processor.

This solution is for you if:

* You are currently using Bitpay as a payment processor but are worried about their commitment to Bitcoin in the future
* You want to be in control of your own funds
* Bitpay compliance team decided to reject your application
* You want lower fees (we support Segwit)
* You want to become a payment processor yourself and offer a BTCPay hosted solution to merchants
* You want a way to support currencies other than those offered by Bitpay
