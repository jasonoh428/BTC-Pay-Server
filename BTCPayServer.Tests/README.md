# How to be started for development

BTCPay Server tests depend on having a proper environment running with Postgres, Bitcoind, NBxplorer configured.
You can however use the `docker-compose.yml` of this folder to get it running.

In addition, when you run a debug session of BTCPay (Hitting F5 on Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2017), it will run the launch profile called `Docker-Regtest`. This launch profile depends on this `docker-compose` running.

This is running a bitcoind instance on regtest, a private bitcoin blockchain for testing on which you can generate blocks yourself.

```
docker-compose up dev
```

You can run the tests while it is running through your favorite IDE, or with

```
dotnet test
```

Once you want to stop

```
docker-compose down
```

If you want to stop, and remove all existing data

```
docker-compose down --v
```

You can run tests on `MySql` database instead of `Postgres` by setting environnement variable `TESTS_DB` equals to `MySql`.

## How to manually test payments

### Using the test bitcoin-cli

You can call bitcoin-cli inside the container with `docker exec`, for example, if you want to send `0.23111090` to `mohu16LH66ptoWGEL1GtP6KHTBJYXMWhEf`:
```
./docker-bitcoin-cli.sh sendtoaddress "mohu16LH66ptoWGEL1GtP6KHTBJYXMWhEf" 0.23111090
```

If you are using Powershell:
```powershell
.\docker-bitcoin-cli.ps1 sendtoaddress "mohu16LH66ptoWGEL1GtP6KHTBJYXMWhEf" 0.23111090
```

You can also generate blocks:
```powershell
.\docker-bitcoin-generate.ps1 3
```

### Using the test litecoin-cli

Same as bitcoin-cli, but with `.\docker-litecoin-cli.ps1` and `.\docker-litecoin-cli.sh` instead. 

### Using the test lightning-cli

If you are using Linux:
```
./docker-customer-lightning-cli.sh pay lnbcrt100u1pd2e6uspp5ajnadvhazjrz55twd5k6yeg9u87wpw0q2fdr7g960yl5asv5fmnqdq9d3hkccqpxmedyrk0ehw5ueqx5e0r4qrrv74cewddfcvsxaawqz7634cmjj39sqwy5tvhz0hasktkk6t9pqfdh3edmf3z09zst5y7khv3rvxh8ctqqw6mwhh
```

If you are using Powershell:
```
.\docker-customer-lightning-cli.ps1 pay lnbcrt100u1pd2e6uspp5ajnadvhazjrz55twd5k6yeg9u87wpw0q2fdr7g960yl5asv5fmnqdq9d3hkccqpxmedyrk0ehw5ueqx5e0r4qrrv74cewddfcvsxaawqz7634cmjj39sqwy5tvhz0hasktkk6t9pqfdh3edmf3z09zst5y7khv3rvxh8ctqqw6mwhh
```

If you get this message:

```
{ "code" : 205, "message" : "Could not find a route", "data" : { "getroute_tries" : 1, "sendpay_tries" : 0 } }
```

Please, run the test `CanSetLightningServer`, this will establish a channel between the customer and the merchant, then, retry.

## FAQ

`docker-compose up dev` failed or tests are not passing, what should I do?

1. Run `docker-compose down --v` (this will reset your test environment)
2. Run `docker-compose pull` (this will ensure you have the lastest images)
3. Run again with `docker-compose up dev`

If you still have issues, try to restart docker.
